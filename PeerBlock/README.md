<h1><img src="resources/icon.png" />PeerBlock</h1>

v518.

a slightly modified version of <code>PeerBlock</code>,

<hr/>

with an updater (external-program) that removes the old cache 
and updates the direct-URL to each list directly to the configuration file, 
(it requires PeerBlock to be closed first), on the next run you should click the 
update-button so PeerBlock will fetch the updated-content of each of the lists.
works well with the classic lists.

the updater-code is beta/unstable so it is currently password-protected, 
to avoid damaging /ones configuration\.
