Complete, portable (not just manifest...)

<code>v4.7.34.201</code> with a modified manifest.
portable by default (settings kept in INI file).


An Old <code>v3.6.0.92</code> is in the resources folder,
is too with modified manifest.
An example on how to script resource-extraction, modifying it, and pushing it back can be found in
https://github.com/eladkarako/mods/blob/master/Rufus/resources
the batch file to do it is https://github.com/eladkarako/mods/blob/master/Rufus/resources/rcdata_unupx.cmd

<sub>there are <code>reshack</code> and <code>reshacker</code> shortcuts, that are helpful if you put this folder in your PATH and want to use old names.. you might need to edit those to make them point to the current place of the main exe...</sub>
