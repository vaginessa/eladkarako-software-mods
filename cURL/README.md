<h1><img src="resources/icon.png"/> cURL</h1>

v7.59.0, updated at March 14<sup><em>th</em></sup>, 2018.

To get the original get: https://curl.haxx.se/download.html#Win32
then: https://bintray.com/artifact/download/vszakats/generic/curl-7.59.0-win32-mingw.zip
compiled by <a href="https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/curl/">Viktor Szakats</a>,
which seems the better one of all.

the resources folder contains <code>curl-7.46.0-win32 compatible with Windows XP.7z</code>,
which should work on older operation-systems.

the <code>curl.cmd</code> is a wrap around the binary,
offering useful switches such as very permissive-ssl, etc...
