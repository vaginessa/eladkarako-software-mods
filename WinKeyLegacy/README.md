<h1><img src="resources/icon.png"/> WinKey-Legacy</h1>

my old (back in 2011) rewrite of "Copernic-Technologies Inc / WinKey" in new delphi I call "WinKey Legacy" that will work with new window-systems, hook still won't work on preserved combinations such as number-keys or win+P, to override it I use autohotkey winkey script. I still like the old GUI back in the xp days, just sentimental feelings I guess :/

It is compatible with original registry-keys of the original WinKey.

it is compatible with Windows 10 (hook),<br/>
but the GUI should run through the file/registry virtualization,<br/>
otherwise it will load-up preety long...<br/>
this is why it doesn't have any manifest.

Perhaps some day I will rewrite it...
