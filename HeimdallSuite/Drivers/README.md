This <code>Drivers</code> folder comes with the Heimdall-Suite,
but I've updated <code>zadig.exe</code> to the latest version (2.3).

<hr/>

the files are slightly modified, unUPX-ed and with modified manifest.

the <code>zadig.ini</code> files that included here, will mostly won't be supported by this version,
ini support was silently-transfered to registry, although some of the values might be effective (no auto-update for example).

<hr/>

See the <code>resources</code> folder for more tweaks, 
and initial reg-file you need to run to make sure there will be no internet-connection initialized for update-checking.

(plus domains to block in your Windows-HOSTS file to make sure of an '100% offline-more').
